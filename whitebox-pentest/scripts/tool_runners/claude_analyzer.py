"""Claude-powered semantic vulnerability analyzer.

This tool runner uses Claude's reasoning capabilities to analyze hotspots
and unverified findings with deeper semantic understanding than pattern
matching or dataflow tools can provide.  It constructs focused context
windows and asks structured questions about exploitability.

This is the AI-native core of VulnScout -- the capability that no other
SAST tool can replicate.

Design principles:
  - Only analyze findings that static tools couldn't resolve (unverified/hotspots)
  - Construct minimal, focused context windows (not entire files)
  - Ask structured questions with constrained output format
  - Never override CPG-verified verdicts
  - Add reasoning as evidence items, not as replacement for tool output

Answer these questions precisely:

2. **Sink**: What dangerous operation is performed? (cite specific function call and line)
3. **Sanitization**: Is there any sanitization between source and sink? Is it effective for {vuln_type}?
4. **Exploitability**: Can an attacker actually trigger this with a crafted input? What constraints exist?
5. **Cross-component impact**: If this involves file upload, user input storage, or data persistence -- what happens to this data after it's saved? Is it rendered in any UI? Is the output escaped?
6. **Verdict**: VERIFIED, FALSE_POSITIVE, or NEEDS_REVIEW
7. **Confidence**: high, medium, or low
8. **Reasoning**: One sentence explaining why (cite the strongest evidence)
